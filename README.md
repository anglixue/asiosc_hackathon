# ASI/OSC hackathon

The code repository for the analysis in ASI/OSC Hackathon

There are three immunologists top challenges included in this Hackathon:

1. Minimal cluster identification/marker extraction: Identifying the ideal/minimal (i.e. 12-15) protein marker combinations to identify the maximal number of cell clusters based on RNA ± CITE-seq reference data set.
    + Item 1a Novel pipeline that allows extraction
    + Item 1b Utility: Lead to better panel choice for subsequent experiments.
2. Cell-cell, protein-protein interaction (visualisation? More refined? Interpretation?
    + Item 2a Don’t reinvent the great databases out there? Rather leverage these so immunologists can better use them.
    + Item 3b Interfacing with the proteogenomics data.
3. Can we use RNA+protein references to inform genes likely to be expressed in FACS subsets? Vice versa?
    + Item 3a Hopefully have a normalised reference FACS whole blood data set. Perhaps healthy vs COVID.


I'll post the analysis pipeline specifically for the challenge #1 and #2
